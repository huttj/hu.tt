Welcome! This is my *Everything Book*. What does that mean? It's a personal knowledge base. It's a place for my ideas and my research, and maybe someday, an entry point into my engagement with a larger community of other such books.

We'll see.

It's got two types of content:

**[[Thoughts]]**
My ideas, questions, and opinions. It's a workspace for me to work these things out, and also a historical record of that work, over time (haven't figured out how to represent that well — nor how to represent asides/footnotes #todo). Quite a fun artifact!

**[[Research]]**
Pulling in info from other sources—books, websites, social media, real-world (meatspace) conversations and exploration.

It's organized by topic. Eventually, I'll build a system to integrate AI (for ideation, summarization, reflection, connection) and chat/community. I'm really excited about surfacing new mechanisms for these things. Better, more fluent UI paradigms should make these things even more valuable and natural. For example, comment-focused AI and block references, two-dimensional threads, and chat as a first-class knowledge-base citizen are some ideas I'd like to explore.
