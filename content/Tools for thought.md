Some ideas, in the order I decided to write them down:

- Want an interactive communication with ChatGPT that I can highlight and comment on particular parts of what it says or what I say, and get it to respond to that in a sub-context. That sub-context could contain a reference to the “above context”, but would be parallel (like an aside) to the main one I started
    - Would like a visual way to represent these and to travel back-and-forth and make loops and to represent those loops in a parsable way. Maybe separate, scrollable windows, where windows to the side represent adjacent ideas (and windows further away horizontally represent even more distant ideas) — as I scroll up and down, the adjacent windows appear/disappear (or better yet come in and out of focus (size, opacity, blur)
    - Would like to highlight as an anchor, and mention anchors in new chats. Would like to search as I’m writing to find relevant ideas (would like to see adjacent ideas to current writing (based on ChatGPT’s analysis of my in-process thoughts) or current anchors I’ve selected) these anchors and their references will create loops. I want a semantic interface for this, not a manual
    - (Literal threading by “dropping” an anchor and then weaving the thread into a new thought island)
- Want something that
    - Lets me type some stuff
    - Get generalized insight on what I’ve typed “from the AI” based on some customizable prompts
    - Let’s me highlight and ask questions/comment and get feedback in the comments
    - Branch off from there
    - “Dialog in your docs” with comments
- Oohhh…also want to “comment” on a doc (or on responses) a

Thinking of some more stuff
* [Granola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-8xlnbIDm8): A tool to help people take better notes in meetings
* [Lex](https://lex.page/): A tool to help people improve their writing with AI feedback and LLM text gen

What am I trying to do? Help people organize their thoughts and do less sifting.
