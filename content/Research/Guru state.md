Feel good reading this, because I had a mental construct that said I _should_ be doing what he’s doing. Sort of free of that trap. Maybe he’s helping, maybe he’s not. But the truth is what I want to do may not make me rich, and it might not be easy, but there’s no longer a voice saying that it _should_.

Not sure if that makes sense. It’s just people who tell you what things could be like or should be like… are always selling something. “I have nothing to sell you,” always sounded too good to be true.

I just realized them being on gear explains their embodied boldness and confident demeanors.

Important not to compare yourself to people unfairly, as you don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes.
