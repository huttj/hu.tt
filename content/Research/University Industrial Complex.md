Let me be clear—I don't think higher education is bad, corrupted, or beyond saving. I think it's a hugely valuable bedrock of our society that is, uh, overgrown in places.

That being said, there's tremendous room for reform, but we have to really understand what is going on and what is working about it, before we go suggesting changes left and right.

Let me try to do that here.

Timeline:

I stumbled on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/eashankotha/status/1718477164285501657) about the infamous Sherwin Williams logo that made me chuckle.

After firing off what I thought to be [an insightful reply](https://twitter.com/JoshuaHutt/status/1718703617455403113)

*Note to self, would be nice to have an automatic archival when pasting a link...*

I read on and noticed [this tweet](https://archive.ph/cLaCz):

I don't know why it caught my fancy—I guess I was thinking "it couldn't be Sherwin Williams funding this research, that would contradict my theory that they're bloated, bored, and printing money." So I dug in and tried to find it.

```

Found the guy, but no mention of partnerships.

Looked at [his lab page](https://archive.ph/uVCGl). It's ugly; reminds me of my old professor-boss' page.

Nice awards, though.

Looked at his [student page](https://archive.ph/CFsDb) and recalled my old prof-boss, thinking about how the students are generally working for free (or extremely low cost), and they're grateful for the opportunity. Contrasted this in my head with my theory of startups, where basically all good, hard work is under-compensated, with a promise of a future return. Human economies are ponzi schemes. (Still trying to withhold judgment!)

At this point, I decided to [enlist ChatGPT to help investigate](https://archive.ph/YR4V6).

Lots of good insights in that conversation (although I was starting to get a bit worried when it was, apparently, reluctant to help me synthesize a perspective). It found [a press release](https://archive.ph/sOxbR), which explains that Dr. Ruan got some money from the [Trask Innovation Fund](https://archive.ph/fWk2Z) (sometimes capitalized, sometimes not).

*As an aside, it's really cool to see that research is actively underway to target all manner of global issues (climate change, food security) — makes me want to get closer to academia.*

At this point, it looked like Purdue was funding the research for its own benefit, which made sense to me. I suspected there might be other sources, but I didn't feel like I could find much more information without asking directly. Not sure I wanted to dig that deep on a whim.

At this point, I was trying to figure out how the whole system works. As I wrote to ChatGPT, it seems like:
- Students at large being encouraged to take out exorbitant, undischargable loans to pay skyrocketing tuition at college and universities
- Athletic arms of universities generating tons of cash for the university and its coaches
- Research being done with public grant money (and student tuition fees??)
- Public companies using those technologies (and paying to license? Where does that money flow happen? Also, large companies like Google and Microsoft are funding their own research--where is the overlap with schools?)
- Student labor is deeply discounted (if anything, it could be portrayed that they are being compelled to pay to participate in this system, and offering their research labor at an enormous discount after they make it through year 4)
- Some groups in the US are advocating for "student loan forgiveness," both a short-term measure and a long term aim to make tuition free (might not change the cost, but just make it opaque to the taxpayer, which makes the whole thing an incentivized compulsory system—you can choose not to go, but you'll pay for it either way)
- Other countries send us their academics, who work here on innovations that we end up owning. Is this a national security risk? Are we getting these people because we're the best and they want to be here, or because it's a strategic move by those foreign countries? (Mainly looking at China)

So, it's a mechanism to funnel humans into research-yielding directions, which can then generate innovation, which is capitalized on, sold to the world, and some of the funds fed back into the system that produced them.

Honestly, that sounds pretty great.

The problem is that this larger purpose is not clearly observable to everyone who is participating in it. Or maybe everyone else gets this, and I'm just slow and dense. Either way, if we can clearly document and describe the system, we can refine it and make it better. We can agree on what parts to regulate and what parts to allow to run differently.

For instance, do we want to federally fund this system by fiat? Or federate it? Schools do their research separately and competitively, but they all feed at the federal teat in one way or another. (There are analogies to draw here between *siblings and strangers*—both compete, but the rules and nature of that competition dramatically differ. I tend to think that humans benefit from having siblings, friends, colleagues, and competitors. Waiting for the only-child hate mail.)

Anyway, there is a lot more to document and think about, but these are my broad strokes for now. Will come back and flesh it out further.

Also found [this insightful thread](https://archive.ph/q94uB) with this slightly off-topic but still glorious comment:

- [College town dynamics](https://youtu.be/3Nq3ye-QCyM?si=T2oVGZS01M9Q5TfL&t=79) — they don't get a lot of "big-time" crime, but lots of petty stuff like brawls, break-ins, etc
