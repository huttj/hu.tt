## My general strategy
How could this be fixed?

Management needs to be aware of the problem, convinced it needs solving, and empowered to fix it. At the same time, realizing that there are incompetent people in technical leadership positions makes it difficult to negotiate, especially if management is inclined to believe them, even though they are inherently untrustworthy (incompetence and malice are effectively the same outcome, here).

Also, the way you present this is important. Just dumping the information on them all at once is a non-starter. They'll go into risk management mode and shut you out. But, if you think of a way to slow-drip it so you
1. Get their attention
2. Let them discover the problem for themselves (in a way that lets them feel like they're the only ones who might see it, if only for a minute), 
3. Lets them be the one to decide to fix it, 
4. Lets you validate their discovery and empathize with their plight (positioning you in a trusted "ally" role), 
5. Allows you to slow-walk a narrative about you trying to solve it (telling them your ideas, including failed ones, which they can shoot down, letting them feel engaged and in control, ultimately landing on your preferred solution that you're skeptical about and try to sell the risks over the benefits), and 
6. Gives them room to take full credit for saving it, with plausible deniability for if it doesn't work (graceful failure mode).... it could work.
