One of my regrets from childhood is that I didn't get a supportive educational experience that let me dive into my interests, head-first. I went to three different primary schools and five high schools, and my impression of them all was...not great.

I think we need an alternative that focuses more on letting students naturally pursue their interests without restriction, and we're at a unique time in history where we could, with some difficulty, achieve that at a unmatched scale. That's one of the few things that I'm truly passionate about building.
