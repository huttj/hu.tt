> [We need something like a e-waste import duty, tax, fee, or 'recycling deposit' on devices with non-replaceable lithium ion batteries.](https://archive.ph/BsDze)

Thinking about how these types of eco-incentives work and change the economics of manufacturing and what makes sense to bring to market.

Also makes me think of the EU and the USB-C change...

What sort of incentives are good to help corral companies through what would otherwise be unsolved collective action problems? Some are external to the core product (e.g., e-waste), and some are internal, or at least, cross-cutting (e.g., charging standards).

Also funny to think about how different countries have different standards that they *don't* have to create explicit regulations to enforce (left-driving cars, power plugs). Maybe there are technically laws for those, but even if there weren't, consumers probably wouldn't let divergent products fly.
