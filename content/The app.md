Okay, so I'm building an app.

Or, rather, I *want* to build an app.

I've been thinking about it for some time. There are a lot of overlapping parts and ideas. But, something is stopping me from actually building it. Hell, I'm hesitating to even *write* about it. Why is that?

Well, first of all, it's hugely ambitious. The goals for the app are pretty bigâ€”I want to build something useful, something that works on an individual scale, but that scales well with others (multiplayer), and that, at a global level, works to combat the misinformation and short attention spans that are dominating humanity at this point.

Whew!

And it is supposed to be the first real big thing that I've built for myself, after years of thinking about what I'd build if I had the time and resources to really focus on building.

And I don't have that time or resources, now. I've squandered it over the past year.

So here I am, finally putting character to digital page.

## Ideas
- Transcribe (Youtube) videos and extract quotes and draw in info with timestamped links to source
- Ingest websites and do the same (summarize with links to highlighted version of archived site)
- Twitter ingestor, etc
- Comment on work
